# Barbershop website

This is a barbershop website I built after I had completed the Udemy course "The Complete jQuery Course: From Beginner to Advanced". I really enjoy using jQuery, it makes designing interactive and dynamic websites straightforward and fun. The results can look fantastic. I built this website using, HTML/CSS with bootstrap and jQuery.

The barbershop itself is fake, and the address listed on the website is a KFC restaurant. The phone number is a standard UK fake phone number.
